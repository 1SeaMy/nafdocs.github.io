The NATO Architecture Framework (NAF) is a standard for developing
Enterprise Architectures. An Enterprise Architecture is a model of a
current or future state of an enterprise. An enterprise could be an
organisation, a system (including the human factors) or a project. The
purpose of enterprise architecture is to capture the complex
dependencies that exist in large-scale systems of systems so as to aid
with decision support. NAF provides a standard way to model the
architecture, by defining:


* [Methodology](../methodology/) – how to develop architectures and how to run an architecture project
* [Viewpoints](../viewpoints/) – conventions for the construction, interpretation and use of architecture views for communicating the enterprise architecture to different stakeholders.
* [Meta-Model](../meta-model/) – a standard ontology for capturing the key architectural elements and their interdependencies.
