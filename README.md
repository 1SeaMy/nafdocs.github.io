# [NATO Architecture Framework](http://nafdocs.github.io)


This repository contains a partial Jekyll port of the NAF
documentation site (nafdocs.org). The purpose of porting the site from
Wordpress to Jekyll is to ensure, we are able to preserve the
documentation for the future and to increase the engagement of all the
stakeholders.

## Status

* Quite a few pages are still missing and be aware that NO images or PDF
  files has been included in the repository - that is on purpose. So
  images are included only by links to the Wordpress web-site.

* Also no part of the MODEM model have been included - angain all
  references links to the original Wordpress site.

* The Viewpoint grid markup and stylesheets have not been
  re-implemented yet.

Collaboration with stakeholders should use the features of Github such
as pull requests and issues.
