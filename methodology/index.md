The NAF methodology is currently under development. It is likely to be based on the [TOGAF(TM) Architecture Development Method (ADM)](http://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf8-doc/arch/chap03.html) with input from other sources such as the [MODAF](http://nafdocs.org/glossary/modaf/) learning portal and systems engineering standards such as [ISO15288](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_15288).

Over time, domain-specific methodologies may be developed for NAF â€“ two current candidates are Human Factors and Security Architectures.
