title: L1 – Node Types

An L1 view specifies the types of logical Node used in the
architecture. The nodes can be organised into a specialisation hierarchy
(subtype-supertype).

## Concerns Addressed

-   User Requirements
-   Operational Planning
-   High-Level Systems Requirements

## Background

An L1 is used to define all the Nodes that will appear in a Logical
Architecture. Nodes are elements of capability that are assembled and
orchestrated in Logical Architecture. The levels of capability provided
by each node are expressed as Measures of Performance, and these may be
dependent on the environments in which the Node is required to operate.

## Usage

-   Initial set up of a Logical Architecture
-   Defining measure of performance for requirements specification
    purposes
-   Defining the types of environment in which Nodes may operate

## Representation

An L1 can either be shown as a diagram that traces nodes to capabilities
(also showing required measures of performance) or as a table:

## Detailed View Description

Nodes are traced to the Capabilities they manifest using the Capability
For Node relationship. In addition, Measures of Performance may be
specified for each node that map to the Measures of Effectiveness of the
Capabilities. Each Measure can be expressed in terms of the environment
– e.g. higher performance may be expected in clear weather than in bad.

The L1 helps to de-clutter an [L2](l2.html) by taking care of the properties
and capabilities mappings that were previously shown in NAF v3 in NOV-2.
It is still possible to show capabilities and properties in an [L2](l2.html)
if required though.
