The L5 Logical States view describes how operational nodes or
activities respond to various events by changing state. The view
represents the sets of events to which the architecture will respond (by
taking an action to move to a new state) as a function of its current
state. Each transition specifies an event and an action.

## Background

An L5 can be used to describe the detailed sequencing of activities or
work flow in the business process. The L5 is particularly useful for
describing critical sequencing of behaviours and timing of operational
activities that cannot be adequately described in [L4 – Logical
Activities](l4.html).

The L5 relates events and states. A change of state is called a
transition. Actions may be associated with a given state or with the
transition between states in response to stimuli (e.g. triggers and
events).
