The Capability to Service Mapping View (C1-S1) depicts which services
contribute to the achievement of a capability.

## Background

If network enabled capability is to be delivered by the orchestration of
loosely couple services (i.e. a service-oriented architecture), it is
important to know which services have the potential to support
particular capabilities. An C1-S1 presents a simple mapping of services
to capabilities, showing which services contribute to which capability.
