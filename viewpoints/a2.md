The A2 Architecture Products view lists the products that describe an
Architecture, and the views to which those products correspond.

## Background

The A2 view specifies the structure of an architecture, and the products
that describe the architecture. Each product may correspond to an
architecture view. This view also traces the architectures onto the
Enterprise Phases they correspond to (see also [E2 – Enterprise
Vision](/e2)) and identifies the key stakeholders, their concerns and
the products that address those concerns (from ISO42010).
