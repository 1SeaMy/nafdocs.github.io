The P4 Resource Functions view addresses resource (human and non-human)
functions – i.e. the activities performed by Resources.

## Background

The primary purposes of the P4 are to:

-   Develop a clear description of the necessary data flows that are
    input (consumed) by and output (produced) by each resource.
-   Ensure that the functional connectivity is complete (i.e. that a
    resource’s required inputs are all satisfied).
-   Ensure that the functional decomposition reaches an appropriate
    level of detail.
-   Provide implementation-specific realisations of the operational
    activities specified in the [L4 – Logical Activities](l4.html) view.

The Functionality Description provides detailed information regarding
the:

-   Allocation of functions to resources.
-   Flow of data between functions.

The P4 is the systems view counterpart to the Activity Model ([L4](l4.html))
of the operational view.

## Usage

-   Description of task workflow.
-   Identification of functional system requirements.
-   Functional decomposition of systems.
-   Relate human and system functions.
