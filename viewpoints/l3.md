The L3 Node Interactions view addresses operational information
exchanges between nodes.

## Background

Information exchanges provide further detail of the interoperability
requirements associated with the operational capability of interest. The
focus is on information exchanges that cross the capability boundary.

Although the primary purpose of this view is to specify information
exchanges, an L3 may also list flows of materiel, energy and human
resources.

## Usage

* Definition of operational concepts.
* Elaboration of capability requirements.
* Definition of collaboration needs.
* Associating capability with a location.
* Problem space definition.
* Operational planning.
* Supply chain analysis.
* Security models – e.g. domain-based security & entity trust models
