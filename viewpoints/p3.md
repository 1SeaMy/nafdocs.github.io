The P3 Systems Connectivity view describes communications networks and
pathways that link communications systems, and provides details
regarding their configuration.

## Background

The networks and pathways documented through these views represent the
physical implementation of the information needlines identified in an
[L2 – Logical Scenario](l2.html) or [L3 – Node Interactions](l3.html) view.

The P3 focuses on the physical characteristics of each link by
specifying attributes. An example of this might be the geographic
location and layout of network components such as routers, switches,
amplifiers and repeaters. Attributes such as capacities (eg bandwidth,
throughput), frequencies used, security encryption methods used and
other descriptive information is usually presented in a corresponding
SV-6 product (though most architecture tools would prompt the architect
to enter such data as the P3 products are being developed). The P3
covers the SV/NSV-2a,b,c views from previous versions of MODAF/NAF,
which define the communications links between systems:

-   SV-2a System Port Specification – defines the ports on each system,
    and the protocol / hardware stack that is specified or implemented
    for each of those ports.
-   SV-2b System to System Port Connectivity – defines the connections
    between individual ports and shows the protocols and hardware spec
    used for each connection.
-   SV-2c System Connectivity Clusters – defines the bundles of system
    to system connections that go to make up a connection between the
    Artefacts that host the connected systems (see SV-1).

## Usage

The purpose of P3 is to provide a comprehensive specification of how
systems are connected, what interfaces each system exposes (ports), the
hardware interface used and the protocols transmitted across the
interface. Key elements are repeated from view to view and are also
common to the [P2 – Resource Connectivity](p2.html) view. These key elements
are:

-   Artefacts (represented as Systems and Platforms).
-   Ports.
-   Protocols.
-   System Port connections.

## Representation

The elements are shown in different perspectives in the different views.
In an [P2](p2.html) the resources (including systems) are logically grouped
by the artefact to which they belong (which could mean located with).
The [P2](p2.html) view also shows how human operators (‘roles’) interact
with systems. In the P3 views, more information is added; in particular,
information about the ports on each system and the protocols which each
port supports. In addition, the P3 views describe which protocols are
supported for specific system-to-system connections. In a P3, the focus
is on systems and the capability configurations they are part of.

It is important to understand the differences between [P2](p2.html) and P3
to ensure that the correct detail is captured in each view. In essence,
the P3 series expands on the [P2](p2.html) by providing more detail of the
physical characteristics of those interactions specified in the SV-1
that are between systems. For example, the [P2](p2.html) interaction
perspective shows a single-line representation of interfaces between
nodes, whereas the P3 would show a more detailed representation of the
communications infrastructure that provides the connections.

The P3 view uses the common term ‘protocol’ as a specialisation of the
NAF term ‘standard’ to describe the standards specifically used in
interface and communication specifications.
