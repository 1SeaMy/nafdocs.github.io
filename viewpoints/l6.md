The L6 Logical Sequence view provides a time-ordered examination of the
exchanges between participating Operational Nodes as a result of a
particular scenario. Each event-trace diagram will have an accompanying
description that defines the particular scenario or situation.

## Background

Operational Event-Trace Descriptions, sometimes called sequence
diagrams, event scenarios or timing diagrams, allow the tracing of
interactions between nodes in a scenario or critical sequence of events.
The node interactions may correspond to flows of information, energy,
materiel or people specified in the [L2 – Logical Scenario](l2.html). The L6
can be used by itself or in conjunction with an [L5 – Logical
States](l5.html) to describe the dynamic behaviour of nodes. The diagram
below shows the components of an L6. The items across the top of the
diagram are operational nodes.

Each node has a vertical timeline associated with it. Specific points
in time can be labelled running down the left-hand side of the diagram.
Directed lines between the node time lines represent interactions (e.g.
information exchanges) between nodes, and the points at which they
intersect the timelines represent the times at which the nodes become
aware of the events.

## Usage

* Analysis of operational events.
* Sequences of interactions between nodes
* Behavioural analysis.
* Identification of non-functional user requirements (input to URD).
* Operational test scenarios.
