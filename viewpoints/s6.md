The purpose of the Service Interactions View (S6) is to specify how a
service interacts with external agents, and the sequence and
dependencies of those interactions.

## Background

An S6 product does not specify the sequencing of an orchestrated set of
services (see [L6 – Logical Sequence](l6.html)). Its purpose is to specify
the general sequence of interactions that are possible for a given
service.
