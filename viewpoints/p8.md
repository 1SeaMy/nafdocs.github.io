The P8 Resource Constraints view specifies functional and non-functional
constraints on the implementation aspects of the architecture (i.e. the
structural and behavioural elements of the Resource viewpoint).

## Background

that make up the Resource architecture. The constraints are specified in
text and may be functional or structural (i.e. non-functional).

Usage

-   Definition of implementation logic.
-   Identification of resource constraints.
