The P7 Physical Data Model view defines the structure of data used by
the Resources in the architecture.

## Background

The P7 is one of the architectural products closest to actual system
design in the framework. It is used to describe how the information
represented in the [L7 Logical Data Model](l7.html) is implemented.

While the mapping between the logical and physical data models is
relatively straightforward, the relationship between the components of
each model (eg entity types in the logical model versus relational
tables in the physical model) is frequently one-to-many or many-to-many.
