The purpose of the S3 is to define the interfaces presented by a
service. A service presents one or more interfaces to consumers (a
“consumer” being any agent capable of using the service – a person, an
organisation, a system or another service). In this case, the architect
specifies provided interfaces. A service may also be capable of using
interfaces exposed by other services, and the architect may specify
these as used interfaces.

## Background

Specifying the interfaces that a service provides and uses defines which
services are compatible with which other services. If Service A provides
an interface, X and Service B can use Interface X then Service B can
call upon at least some of the functionality of Service A.
