The P5 Resource States view describes how Resources change state in
response to events and other stimuli.

## Background

A P5 view identifies the states a Resource can be, the allowable changes
between those states, and the triggers that cause the state changes.

## Usage

-   Definition of states, events and state transitions (behavioural
    modelling).
-   Identification of constraints (input to System Requirements
    Document).
