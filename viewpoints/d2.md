*NAF v3: NOV-4 MODAF: OV-4*

The D2 Deployed Resources view covers the structure of specific,
individual Resources. This could be actual instances of systems,
organisations or natural resources.

## Background

A D2 shows how specific individual resources are deployed and
configured. The scope for D2 is broad and covers human and non-human
resources. D2 can therefore be used for depicting organisational
structures (as covered in NOV-4 Actual in NAF 3.1). D2 is broader than
OV-4, however as it also covers equipment, systems and natural
resources.

A D2 view may be used to:

-   Specify configuration of deployed resources.
-   Identify architecture stakeholders.
-   Identify process owners.
-   Illustrate current or future organisation structures.
