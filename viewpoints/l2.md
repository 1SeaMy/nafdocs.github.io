*NAF v3: NOV-2 MODAF: OV-2 DNDAF: OV-2, SecV-1/7 (logical)*

The L2 Logical Scenario view shows, at a high level, the interactions
between logical nodes and places them in the context of location(s).

## Background

The primary purpose of the L2 View is to specify nodes (elements of
capability) in context of each other. The context is usually expressed
in terms of the information that flows between the nodes (e.g. the
information flow requirements between capabilities in a given scenario).
The context may also be flows of materiel, human resource or energy.

Since NAF v3, the L2 has been developed to:

* Adopt a more formal definition of logical flows to represent node connections.
* Support the introduction of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).
* Accommodate the use of known resources (as defined in [L2 – Resource Structure](l2.html)).

## Usage

* Definition of operational concepts.
* Elaboration of capability requirements.
* Definition of collaboration needs.
* Associating capability with a location.
* Problem space definition.
* Operational planning.
* Supply chain analysis.

## Security Usage

The L2 view is enhanced with additional features for modelling security:

* Security domain specification
* Logical entity trust models
* Threat specification (e.g. threat vectors) & counter-capability specifications

## Representation

The following L2 example shows how security domains can be specified at
a logical level:

The following example is a simple entity trust model described at a logical level:

An L2 may also show the Operational Activities performed by each node:

The required locations for Nodes may also be specified:

![l2 example locations](http://nafdocs.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/l2-example-locations.png)

Care must be taken when using locations, however. L2 is intended to be
a Logical model (i.e. solution independent), and in many cases the
location will not be known at design time.

## Detailed View Description

*Julie – take care here when pasting in the MODAF documentation. L2
is not quite the same as OV-2. It is now preferred to put the
capabilities and measures in L1 (though we still allow it in L2 if
necessary). Also, the service orchestration is not in L2 any more, so
the service examples go.*
