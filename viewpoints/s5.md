The purpose of the Service States View (S5) is to specify the possible
states a service may have, and the possible transitions between those
states.

## Background

It is generally considered good practice to make services stateless –
i.e. consumers of a service are not aware of what state the service is
in. However, in specifying a service, it is often necessary to specify
the allowable states so as to constrain how implementations of the
service will behave. S5 is a specification of those states, and the
possible transitions between them.
