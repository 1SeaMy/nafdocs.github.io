*NAF v3: NSOV-1/NAV-2 MODAF: SOV-1/AV-2*

The Service Taxonomy View (S1) specifies a hierarchy of services. The
elements in the hierarchy are service specifications (rather than
service implementations), and the relationships between the elements are
specialisations – i.e. one service is a special type of another.

## Background

The purpose of an S1 is to provide a governance structure for a
Service-Oriented Architecture. Along with [S3 (Service
Interfaces)](s3.html), it specifies a standard library of service
specifications for an enterprise, which service implementers are
expected to conform to.

## Usage

-   SOA governance.
-   Identification of services.
-   Service planning.
-   Service audit.
-   Service gap analysis.
-   Providing reference services for architectures.
-   Tailoring generic services for specific applications.

## Representation

-   Tabulation.
-   Hierarchical (connected shapes).
-   UML class diagram.

### Detailed View Description

In NAF terms, a service is an implementation-independent specification
of a packaged element of functionality and/or capability. There is
potential for confusion between services and capabilities. The key
indicator of a service is that it provides a standard interface to
consumers. This means that services may be used as “wrappers” for one or
more capability in order to provide a standard method of access to the
capability. A well-designed service taxonomy provides a set of
specifications for capability providers to adhere to.

An S1 depicts services, specialisation relationships between services,
service attributes and service policy (i.e. constraints). A service
taxonomy persists over time (an architect may wish to specify
historical, current or future services) and may be referenced by
multiple architectures.

In S1, services are only defined in the abstract, i.e. S1 does not
specify how a service is to be implemented. An S1 is structured as a
specialisation hierarchy of services, with the most general at the root
and most specific at the leaves.

An S1 is structured using only specialisation relationships between
elements (super-subtype). Any service that specialises from another must
implement all the functionality of its parent, and provide all the same
input and output interfaces of its parent; in other words, any
specialised service shall be entirely compatible with its parent
(however, it may add functionality and interfaces). For example, if a
service, “Printing”, requires input of paper size and ink colours, a
service, “Hi-Resolution Printing”, that specialises from it must also
accept these parameters and produce equivalent behaviour when initiated.

Services may have attributes and constraints (service policy) defined
against them. Attributes are inherited by specialised services. Where an
attribute is specified for a service, implementations of that service
shall specify their values for the attribute. The example below shows an
availability attribute defined against the top service. All other
services inherit that attribute, and the WarfightingService sets a
constraint (service policy) that the availability shall be greater than
95%. This policy is then inherited by the three situational awareness
services. Note that policy may be overridden in specialised services.
