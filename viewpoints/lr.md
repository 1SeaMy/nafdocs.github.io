layout: page
id: lr
viewpoint: logical
---

The Lr view specifies the logical threads (lines of development) for a
set of projects and programmes. The status of each of these threads can
be shown at the various milestones in the projects or programmes.

## Background

The Lr view is primarily intended to support the acquisition process
across multiple projects or programmes, including the management of
dependencies between projects and the integration of all the DLODs to
achieve a successfully integrated military capability.

Use of the Lr view should support the management of capability delivery
and be aligned with [Cr Capability Phasing](cr.html) view.

## Usage

-   Project management and control (including delivery timescales).
-   Project dependencies and the identification of associated risk.
-   Portfolio management
-   Through Life Management Planning (TLMP).
