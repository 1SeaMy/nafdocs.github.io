*NAF v3: NCV-1 MODAF: StV-1*

The C2 view provides the high-level scope for the architecture and a
strategic context for the capabilities the architecture contains. In
essence it describes the end-state for any business transformation
activity.

## Concerns Addressed


-   [Enterprise Strategy](/glossary/enterprise-strategy/)
-   [Capability Planning](/glossary/capability-planning/)

## Background


The purpose of an C2 is to provide a strategic context for the
capabilities described in the architecture and to specify the scope for
the architecture.

The C2 is high-level and describes the vision, goals, enduring tasks and
capabilities using terminology that is easily understood by
non-technical readers.

## Usage


-   Capture and communication of the strategic vision related to
    capability evolution.
-   Identify the capabilities required to meet the vision and goals
-   Identify the required timescales for the capabilities (as opposed to
    [Cr](Cr.html) which provides a summary of when projects are estimated to
    deliver capability)
-   Identify any enduring tasks the enterprise performs

## Detailed Product Description

The C2 defines the strategic context for a group of capabilities
described in the architecture by outlining the vision for an enterprise
over a bounded period of time. It describes the high level goals and
strategy for the enterprise, and the level of capability the enterprise
is expected to achieve over time.

An C2 can provide the blueprint for a transformational initiative, by
showing the expected capabilities that phases of an enterprise will
exhibit.

C2s may also be textual descriptions of the overarching objectives of
the transformation or change programme that the Enterprise is engaged
in. Of key importance is the identification of Enterprise Goals,
together with the desired outcomes and measurable benefits associated
with these.

The C2 only shows the capabilities exhibited by enterprises; it does not
show how the enterprise is structured in order to deliver those
capabilities – [L2 Logical Scenario](l2.html), is used to define the logical
structure of the enterprise, and the individual logical nodes in the
enterprise that deliver the capability. SV-1 & OV-4 are used to show the
physical and organisational structure of the enterprise.

The Vision Statement in a C2 view may be structured in such a way as to
express the required capabilities, desired effects and enterprise goals:

The Enterprise Goals and Capabilities are ‘enduring’, that is they are
intended to provide an enduring framework across the lifetime of the
enterprise that is being modelled. An Enterprise, on the other hand, is
essentially time-bounded; it has a start and end date. It is broken into
a set of phases for capability planning purposes. The time periods
associated with these phases are sometimes referred to as ‘epochs’ by
military planners although NAF does not use this specific terminology.

![c2-example-3](http://nafdocs.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/c2-example-3.png)

It is sometimes necessary in NAF to identify one Enterprise Phase as
being that represents the ‘As Is’ capability of the Enterprise.

Within the C2, certain Enterprise Goals are identified. These goals
relate to the entire enterprise lifetime, they are not specific to an
Enterprise Phase. Each goal may optionally include attributes associated
with the measurable outcomes that relate to it – this is intended to
provide a high-level link between enterprise management and benefits
management.

As indicated in the figure above, a C2 may optionally also define a set
of sub-enterprises that the enterprise of interest has. This is
important within a collaborative architecting community as it could be
that a different organisation or team has responsibility for modelling
one of the sub-enterprises.
