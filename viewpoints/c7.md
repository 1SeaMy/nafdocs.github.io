## Background

The capability requirements (and existing capabilities) are often
expressed in terms of measures of effectiveness (MoE). These are
high-level metrics used to judge the level of capability. A C7 view
lists the MoEs against the capabilities they are applicable to.

## Usage

-   Setting Capability Requirements
-   Military Estimates
-   Strategic Reviews
-   Planning Assumptions

## Representation

-   Table (capabilities on one axis, measure categories on the other)
-   UML Classes with property definitions

## Detailed View Description

C7 is presents measure categories that can be used to judge level of
capability. It traces measure categories to the capabilities for which
they are relevant.

simply specifies what types of measure apply to each Capability.
