title: C3 – Capability Dependencies

The C3 view describes dependencies between capabilities. It also defines
logical composition of capabilities (i.e. capability clusters).

## Concerns Addressed

-   [Capability Management](/glossary/capability-management/)

## Background


The C3 is intended to provide a means of analysing the dependencies
between capabilities and between capability clusters. The composition of
capabilities (into clusters) is logical, and the purpose of the clusters
is to guide enterprise management.

## Usage


-   Identification of capability dependencies.
-   Capability management (impact analysis for options, disposal etc).

## Representation


-   ‘Nested box’ Diagram.
-   UML Class Diagram.
-   UML Composite Structure Diagram.
-   SysML Structural Diagrams.

## Detailed Product Description

The C3 describes the relationships between capabilities. It also defines
logical groupings of capabilities. This contrasts with [C1
(Capabilities)](c1.html) which also deals with relationships between
capabilities; but C1 only addresses specialisation and composition
relationships (i.e. capability taxonomy).

The C3 is intended to provide a means of analysing the dependencies
between capabilities and between capability clusters. In particular, it
will highlight potential integration requirements and the interactions
needed between acquisition projects in order to achieve the overall
capability.

The recommended notation for C3 is a functional dependency diagram which
shows how functions are clustered together and the relationships between
the individual functions or clusters of functions. It may also be useful
to supplement the functional dependency diagram with a functional
n-squared diagram. The following four examples show the same C3 view
presented in different ways.

The example above shows simple structure and traceability.

![c3-example-2](http://nafdocs.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/c3-example-2.png)

Above is the same information shown in grid form.

![c3-example-3](http://nafdocs.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/c3-example-3.png)

The example above is UML, using a composite class diagram approach.

![c3-example-4](http://nafdocs.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/c3-example-4.png)

The example above is UML again, but this time using aggregation
relationships instead of composite diagrams.

## Key Elements and Their Relationships

![c3-hlmm](http://nafdocs.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/c3-hlmm.png)

The data in an C3 can include:

-   Capability.
-   Capability Dependency (relationship).
-   Capability Composition (relationship).
