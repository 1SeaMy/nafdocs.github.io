*NAF v3: NOV-6a MODAF: OV-6a*

An L8 Operational Rules Model specifies operational or business rules
that are constraints on the way that business is done in the Enterprise.

## Background

L8 is used to constrain the logical architecture without forcing a
particular solution. L8 is used for rules which are not expressed as
behavioural models, interactions or measures of effectiveness – i.e.
they are textual statements of requirement that constrain the
architecture.

## Usage

* Definition of doctrinally correct operational procedures.
* Definition of business rules.
* Identification of operational constraints.
