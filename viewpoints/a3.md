title: A3 – Architecure Correspondence

*From ISO42010*

The A3 Architecture Correspondence view identifies the relationships
between architectural elements.

## Background

ISO42010 introduces the idea of architecture correspondence and
correspondence rules. Quoting from ISO/IEC42010; *“A correspondence
defines a relation between AD elements. Correspondences are used to
express architecture relations of interest within an architecture
description (or between architecture descriptions). Correspondences can
be governed by correspondence rules. Correspondence rules are used to
enforce relations within an architecture description (or between
architecture descriptions).”*

NAF has a number of relationships, used throughout the framework. Rather
than identify each relationship here, those relationships are shown in
each meta-model excerpt for each view. Each view shows “**Key Elements
and Their Relationships**” and “**Meta-Model Excerpt**“. In the
meta-model excerpt, relationships are depicted as boxes with thin
borders.
