The L4 Operational Activity Model describes the operations that are
normally conducted in the course of achieving a mission or a business
goal. It describes operational activities (or tasks), Input/Output flows
between activities and to/from activities that are outside the scope of
the Architecture.

## Background

L4 describes the operational processes and activities that are being
conducted within the mission or scenario. L4 can be used to:

* Clearly delineate lines of responsibility for activities when coupled with [L2 – Logical Scenario](/l2).
* Uncover unnecessary Operational Activity redundancy.
* Make decisions about streamlining, combining, or omitting activities.
* Define or flag issues, opportunities, or operational activities andtheir interactions (information flows among the activities) that need to be scrutinised further.
* Provide a necessary foundation for depicting activity sequencing and timing in [L8 – Logical Constraints](l8.html), [L5 – Logical States](l5.html), and [L6 – Logical Sequence](l6.html).

L4 activity models describe the business processes associated with the
architecture, as well as the:

* Relationships or dependencies among the business processes.
* Information exchanged between business processes.
* External interchanges (from/to business processes that are outside the scope of the model).

An operational activity is a logical process, specified independently of
how it is carried out. To maintain this independence from
implementation, logical nodes in [L2](l2.html) are used to represent the
structure which carries out the operational activities. Operational
activities are realised as functions ([P4](p4.html)) which are the “how” to
the Operational Activities’ “what”. That is, they are specified in terms
of the resources that carry them out.
