title: C4 â€“ Standard Processes
layout: page
---

*NAF v3: NCV-6 MODAF: StV-6*

The C4 specifies standard (e.g. doctrinal) operational activities, and
optionally traces them to the capabilities they support.

## Concerns Addressed


-   [Doctrine Production](/glossary/doctrine-production/)
-   [Operational Analysis](/glossary/operational-analysis/)

## Background


Some processes are standard across the whole enterprise, or even more
than one enterprise. The C4 specifies Standard Operational Activities
that can be re-used across multiple logical architectures (e.g. in
[L4](l4.html)).

## Usage

-   Specification of doctrine
-   Tracing capabilities to enduring tasks.
-   Tracing capabilities to standard operational activities
-   Capability audit.

## Representation

-   Table.
-   Tracing Diagram.

## Detailed View Description

The C4 view specifies the Standard Operational Activities, and the
Enduring Tasks and Capabilities they support.

It is created as part of the conceptual Architecture (i.e. before the
creation of supporting Logical Views), and will consist of a library of
pre-defined activities taken from Doctrine. Consequently, the
Operational Activities in the [L4](l4.html) should, therefore, be
specialisations of the Standard Operational Activities from the C4.

An C4 is usually shown in the form of a table, optionally listing the
supported capabilities and enduring tasks.
