*NAF v3: NSV-1/NOV-4 MODAF: SV-1/OV-4*

A P2 Resource Structure view addresses the composition and (high-level)
interaction of resources.

## Background

The P2 links together the operational and systems architecture views by
depicting how resources are structured and interact in order to realise
the logical architecture specified in an [L2 – Logical Scenario](l2.html). A
P2 may represent the realisation of a requirement specified in a
[L2](l2.html) (i.e. in a to-be architecture) and so there may be many
alternative Resource view suites that could realise the operational
requirement. Alternatively, in an as-is architecture, the [L2](l2.html) may
simply be a simplified, logical representation of the P2 to allow
communication of key information flows to non-technical stakeholders.

A P2 can be used to specify typical (or template) organisation
structures, and also identify how human resources interact with each
other and with systems.

A P2 can provide a simplified representation of a pathway or network,
usually depicted graphically as a connector (i.e. a line with possible
amplifying information). The P2 depicts interactions between resources
that are of interest to the architect. Note that interactions between
systems may be further specified in detail in the [P3 – Resource
Connectivity](p3.html) view.

Resources may be decomposed in a P2 to any level (i.e. depth) of
decomposition that the architect sees fit. A P2 may also identify the
physical asset (e.g. platforms) at which resources are deployed and can
show the operational nodes that utilise those resources. In many cases,
an operational node depicted in a [L2](l2.html) product may well be the
logical representation of the resource shown in P2.

## Usage

-   Definition of system concepts.
-   Definition of system options.
-   Human – System interactions.
-   Typical Organisation structures.
-   Interface requirements capture.
-   Capability integration planning.
-   System integration management.
-   Operational planning (capability configuration definition).

## Key Elements and Their Relationships

![p2-hlmm](http://nafdocs.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/p2-hlmm.png)

The data in a P2 can include:

-   Resource Type (all subtypes thereof)
-   Configured Resource Type
-   Resource Type Configuration (whole-part relationship)
-   Resource Interaction (all subtypes thereof)

Resources are assembled as Configured Resource Types – there is one (and
only one) Configured Resource Type for each usage of a Resource Type in
the structure. This enables components, sub-systems, etc. of the same
type but used in different positions to be be individually identified.
This is particularly useful for interactions – e.g. being able to
identify the connection the left-hand pump as distinct to the connection
to the right-hand pump of the same type.
