title: C1 – Capability Taxonomy

viewpoint: capability

The C1 view covers capabilities and the hierarchical relationships
between them.

## Concerns Addressed

-   [Capability Planning](/glossary/capability-planning/)
-   [Capability Management](/glossary/capability-management/)

## Background


C1 specifies all the capabilities that are referenced throughout one or
more architectures – i.e. one C1 may provide the definitive list of
capabilities for a number of logical and resource architectures.

The capabilities may be organised into specialisation hierarchies
(taxonomies). Measures of effectiveness may be specified for each
capability. Note that measures of effectiveness are inherited down a
capability taxonomy.


## Usage

-   Identification of existing and required capabilities.
-   Source for the derivation of cohesive sets of KURs.
-   Providing reference capabilities for multiple architectures.

## Representation

-   Tabulation.
-   Hierarchical (Connected Shapes).
-   UML Class Diagram (with generalisation relationships and property
    definitions).


## Detailed View Description

The C1 specifies a hierarchy of capabilities. A capability taxonomy
persists over time (an architect may wish to specify historical, current
or future capability) and may be referenced by multiple architectures.
The capabilities specified in a C1 are extensively re-used in logical,
service-oriented, and resource views; in this way the concept of
capability is integral to any NAF architecture.

In NAF, a capability is a description of an ability to do something. In
C1, the capabilities are only described in the abstract – i.e. C1 does
not specify how a capability is to be implemented. A C1 is most commonly
structured as a specialisation hierarchy of capabilities, with the most
general at the root and most specific at the leaves. Capabilities may
have measures of effectiveness – these measure categories are inherited
by sub-capabilities:

C1 is a capability taxonomy view. [C3](c3.html) is the view that describes
dependencies between the capabilities shown in the C1 taxonomy.

The capabilities in a C1 are related by specialisation relationships
that assert one capability is a special case of another (e.g.
*ground-based ISTAR* is a specialisation of *ISTAR*).

In NAF, Capabilities are ‘enduring’, that is they are intended to
provide an enduring framework across the lifetime of one or more
enterprises. This means that it is feasible to develop a capability
taxonomy that will apply to all Enterprise Phases listed in a [C2](c2.html),
and an C1 may even cover more than one logical / resource architecture.

**Key Elements and Their Relationships**

The data in an C1 can include:

-   Capability (and specialisation relationships between Capabilities).
-   Measure Category (for specifying Measures of Effectiveness relevant
    to Capabilities)
