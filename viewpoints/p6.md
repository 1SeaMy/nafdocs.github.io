*NAF v3: NSV-10c MODAF: SV-10c*

The P6 Resource Sequence view provides a time-ordered examination of the
interactions between Resources. These are usually depicted as
event-trace diagrams and will have an accompanying description that
defines the particular scenario or situation.

## Background

P6 products are valuable for moving to the next level of detail from the
initial solution design, to help define a sequence of functions and
system data interfaces, and to ensure that each participating resource
or system port role has the necessary information it needs, at the right
time, in order to perform its assigned functionality.

Usage

-   Analysis of resource events impacting operation.
-   Behavioural analysis.
-   Identification of non-functional system requirements (input to
    System Requirement Document).
