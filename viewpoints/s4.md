The Service Functions View (S4) defines the behaviour of a service in
terms of the functions it is expected to perform.

## Background

S4 is the key behavioural specification for services. Equivalent in
nature to [L4 (Logical Activities)](l4.html) and [P4 (Resource
Functions)](p4.html), it specifies a set of functions that a service
implementation is expected to perform.
