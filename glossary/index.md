*  Architecture

   Fundamental concepts or properties of a system [enterprise] in its environment embodied in its elements, relationships, and in the principles of its design and evolution. [from ISO/IEC 42010]

*  Architecture Framework

   Conventions, principles and practices for the description of architectures established within a specific domain of application and/or community of stakeholders. [from ISO/IEC 42010]

*  Architecture Meta-Model

*  Capability

   The ability of one or more resources to deliver a specified type of effect or a specified course of action.

   Note: The term “capability” has a number of different interpretations (esp. in the military community). In NAF, the term is reserved for the specification of an ability to achieve an outcome. In that sense, it is dispositional – i.e. resources may possess a Capability even if they have never manifested that capability. The MODEM definition of Capability expresses this dispositional aspect from a set-theoretic point of view; “A DispositionalProperty that is the set of all things that are capable of achieving a particular outcome.”

*  Capability Configuration

   A composite structure representing the physical and human resources (and their interactions) that when brought together provide one or more Capabilities.

*  Capability Planning

*  Doctrine Production

*  MODAF

   The UK Ministry of Defence Architecture Framework. NAF has been based on MODAF since v3.

*  Operational Analysis

*  Operations Planning

*  Strategic Planning

*  System

   A man-made configuration with one or more of the following: hardware, software, data, humans, processes (e.g., processes for providing service to users), procedures (e.g. operator instructions), facilities, materials and naturally occurring entities”. [based on ISO/IEC 15288 definition]
