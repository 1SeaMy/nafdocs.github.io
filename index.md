Welcome to the documentation site for the NATO Architecture
Framework. This site is currently in development and still needs
work. If you are a representative of a NATO member nation (or PfP
nation) and wish to help us edit the site, please contact the NATO
Architecture CAT to get a username and password.


The NATO Architecture Framework is in five main parts:


* [Introduction](introduction/) – An overview of NAF, what it’s for and who uses it.
* [Methodology](methodology/) – How to use NAF
* [Viewpoints](viewpoints/) – The types of NAF Views and their levels of abstractions
* [Stakeholder](stakeholder/) Viewpoints – Architectural stakeholders and their viewpoints / concerns
* [Meta-Model](meta-model/) – the NAF elements and their relationships
